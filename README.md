Optimizing the Rapid DNA Matching Process for UK Police Forces Using Operational Analytics

**Challenges**
1. The traditional DNA matching process takes up to two weeks due to the speed limitations of the DNA machine.
2. Despite improvements in digital and DNA technologies, there is a challenge with queuing of the samples in the process.
3. The optimization of the Rapid DNA operational process is necessary to reduce processing time to under 24 hours.
4. The queuing occurs at four stages: Sample Collection, Sample Preparation, DNA Sequencing, and Sample Validation.

**Method**
There are 3 models constructed: 
1. Average Solution – Model built with the average value of the variables and formulas.
2. Monte Carlo Simulation – Model built with the @Risk Probability Distribution Functions(PDF) and formulas.
3. What-if scenario – constructing plausible scenarios that can help achieving at least half of samples from one week are processed in under 24 hours.

**Results**
- The average model showed that about 51% of the samples could be processed within 24 hours, while Monte Carlo simulations showed that reducing the DNA sequencer capacity and technician job tasks improved processing times.
- The mean total time for samples in the system under the Monte Carlo simulation was significantly higher, with the scenario where improving the DNA Sequencer Capacity and recuding Technician Waiting time provides the best results at 54.65% of samples processed in under 24 hours.
